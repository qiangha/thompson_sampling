Research on a well-known statistical learning algorithm

Thompson Sampling algorithm is a well known Bayesian algorithm for solving stochastic multi-armed bandit.At each time step the algorithm chooses each arm with probability proportional to it being the current best arm.We modify the strategy by introducing a paramter h which alters the importance of the probability of an arm being the current best arm. I show that the optimality of Thompson sampling is robust to this perturbation within a range of parameter values for two arm bandits.
